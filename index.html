 	<h1> Raphael's <em>The School of Athens</em> </h1>
 	<p>
 		<em>The School of Athens</em>, lauded as "Raphael's masterpiece and the perfect embodiment of the classical spirit of the Renaissance," was commissioned by Pope Julius II in 1509. It famously depicts many of the most brilliant and influential philosophers, mathematicians, and scientists of classical antiquity. The positions of the figures in the picture are allusions to their thought and works. See a close-up of <a href="plato_and_aristotle.html">Plato and Aristotle</a> for an example of this.
